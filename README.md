## Skills

- **Programming languages:**   Python, R programming, C++, JAVA, C programming

## Projects

- **“Diabetics Prediction Using Logistic Regression”** (https://github.com/bindhulasya/Diabetics-prediction-using-Logistic-Regression):
  The data was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes 
  Database. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. All patients here belong to the Pima Indian 
  heritage and are females of ages 21 and above. The main goal of this project is Predicting whether the person is having diabetics or not.

- **"Exploring Crime Trends in Los Angeles: An Analysis of Recent Data"** (https://github.com/bindhulasya/Exploring-Crime-Trends-in-Los-Angeles-An-Analysis-of-Recent-Data):
  crime data in Los Angeles using R programming language. The purpose of this analysis was to understand the nature of crime in the city and identify potential hotspots and trends.

- **“Life Expectancy (WHO)”** (https://github.com/bindhulasya/Life-Expectancy-WHO):
  It was found that effect of immunization and human development index was not considered in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple linear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries. Hence, this gives motivation to resolve the factors on regression model based on multiple linear regression while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. The factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates are undertaken from lot of studies in the past. This will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. The observations of this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.
